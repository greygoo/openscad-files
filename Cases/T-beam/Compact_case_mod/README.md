## T-Beam Case

This is mod of the T-Bean Case at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4859868 using Openscad to fit the more common T-Bean models with the antenna not being rotated by 90 degrees. It consists of modfied case stl files and a parameterized reimplementation of the labels and the screen shield. The non modified parts have been added for convenience.

### Modified parts

These parts are hacked version of the original files and can be printed as they are. Yes, it's an ugly hack, but it works ;)
```
Modified_Compact_Antenna_Case_Body_1.0.scad
Modified_Compact_Antenna_Case_Face_1.0.scad
```

### Reimplemented parts

These parts have been created from scratch in Openscad to make them parameterized. In order to change the labels, nameplate text or screen dimensions, open them in Openscad and change the variables at the beginning of the file according to yur needs.
```
Reimplemented_Compact_Antenna_Case_Label_parameterized_1.0.scad
Reimplemented_Compact_Antenna_Case_Nameplate_parameterized_1.0.scad
Reimplemented_Compact_Antenna_Case_ScreenShield_parameterized_1.0.scad
```

### Unmodified parts

These parts have not been touched and are identical to the original ones.
```
original_files/Compact_Antenna_Case_Back_1.0.STL
original_files/Compact_Antenna_Case_Button_1.0.STL
original_files/Compact_Antenna_Case_Nut_Plate_1.0.STL
